# bigdata_utils

Here I have put together a set of utilities that will help you not to copy standard things from project to project.

The **spark** directory contains methods for creating a session, writing data to Hive tables and to HDFS.

The **postgres** directory contains methods for creating an SQLAlchemy engine and JDBC parameters for use in Spark.

In the **some_functions** directory, I will collect different methods for different tasks that may be needed.

Suggestions, additions and improvements are welcome!
